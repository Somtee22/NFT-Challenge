## My process
i first put up all the HTML structures before moving further with my designs ans styling using CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learnt how to use most of the CSS selectors i.e id and class,also got more familiar with the CSS Box models-padding and margin.
Made use of "Align-items" for the first time.Interesting!!!
